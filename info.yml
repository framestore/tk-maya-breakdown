                     Each item in the list returned should be a
                     dictionary containing a node, type and a path key. The node key should be a
                     maya node name, the type key is a reference type and the path key is a full
                     path to the file currently being referenced.

        type: hook
        description: Update a collection of nodes to another version. The data parameter is a list
                     of dictionaries, every dictionary contains the three keys node_name, node_type
                     and path. The node_name and node_type are simply the same data that the 
                     scene scan hook returned, and the path value is the new path to load.
